<img src="Images/251_crop.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:10px"><p>The <a href="http://www.miniare.org">MINIARE</a> and <a href="http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/research/cambridgeilluminations">Cambridge Illuminations</a> projects are the research platform of a major exhibition that celebrates the bicentenary of the Fitzwilliam Museum's foundation in 2016. The exhibition displays over 100 of the Fitzwilliam Museum's finest illuminated manuscripts representing the leading artistic centres of medieval and Renaissance Europe. Visitors are invited to examine in detail the artistic, intellectual and historic significance of the manuscripts. Digital displays allow them to leaf through multiple paintings within a manuscript; over-lay images of the same painting captured with different techniques; discover the pigments and techniques identified through cutting-edge, non-invasive scientific analyses; follow the trade routes that supplied artists' materials across Asia and Europe; and explore the relationships between the individuals involved in the manuscripts' production and early use.</p>
<p>The exhibition re-constructs the creative process, from the artists' original ideas through their choice of pigments and technical expertise to the finished works. It demonstrates how artists strove to break the barrier between images and viewers by engaging the senses, stimulating the mind, and stirring up emotions. The catalogue, written by an international team of experts and illustrated in full colour, is available for purchase online <a href="http://www.fitzwilliammuseumshop.co.uk/pa_exhibition/colour-the-art-and-science-of-illuminated-manuscripts-july-to-december-2016/?filter_product_cat=58">at the Fitzwilliam Museum shop</a>.</p>
